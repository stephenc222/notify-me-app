# Notify Me

## Overview

This is the backend for Notify Me, a cross-platform app to give you notifications of news updates for a custom search topic of your choosing.

## Getting Started

You need to have a `secret.js` file, at the root of this repo, that has a named export called `API_KEY` which is your api key for [News API]('https://newsapi.org/').
In addition, you need to have a local redis server up and running as well 

Notify Me is powered by News API.
